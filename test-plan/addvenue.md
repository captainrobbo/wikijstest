<!-- TITLE: Adding a Venue to the Database -->

The athletic venue database on the OpenTrack site is very extensive and consists of venues all around the globe. However, it does not contain every venue and we invite users to add to the list to help complete the database. You are able to add new venues. 

For any additional details to add to existing venues, please email *support@opentrack.run* and let us know what needs to be added/changed.

# 1.1 Viewing the Existing List
From the OpenTrack homepage *data.opentrack.run* click Venues/Tracks or alternatively head to *data.opentrack.run/v*.

You should be presented with the following screen: 

*Venue Selection*
![Venue Selection](/uploads/venues/venue-selection.png "Venue Selection")

From this page you can enter an address or click *Near me* and allow the page to access your location. 

Alternatively, choose a country on the right hand side (*Browse the directory*) to view the list of the country's venues. 

# 1.2 Adding to the List
1. Ensure you are logged in and if not, please log in. 
2. Find the location on the map that you wish to add a venue.
3. At the top right of the map there is a button that reads *Add track near here*.
4. This will give you a clicker and you can click on the map exactly where you wish to add the venue.
5. From the resulting screen, fill in the appropriate information, should you have it.
6. Click the blue *Save* button.

Email *support@opentrack.run* with any issues.
