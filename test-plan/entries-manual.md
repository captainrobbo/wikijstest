<!-- TITLE: Training Manual - Entering Competitions -->

# 1.1 Introduction
One of the major purposes of the Federation Management System is to manage entries to competitions and assign competitors to events.

In order to do this the user needs to have Team Manager privileges. Request this by contacting support@opentrack.run

Once access privileges to the competition have been granted, you must be logged in.

*Log-In Screen*

Following this, navigate to the competition in question. From the homepage, click *Competitions* and then use the search bar to narrow the results field before clicking on your competition. 

N.B. If you are trying to find a previous competition, click the *Past* tab first.

*Competition Micro-Site*

Once into your competition home-page, click *Teams*.

From here, you can view the competitors (see CMS Manual 2.9), and the teams entered to the competition.

*Teams Entered*

If your club is not showing, your Team Manager privileges will show a button at the top right saying *Add BJUNK*. Here BJUNK is the club code for an Estonian club. Click this to enter your club into the competition. Following this:

As a Team Manager, select the club you are managing. Example here is EMAC. From this page, you can view the competitors of this club and what events they are assigned to, either in: 

*List View - Competitors*
![List View - Competitors](/uploads/competition-entries-images/picture-4.png "Picture 4")

*Grid View - Competitors*
![Grid View - Competitors](/uploads/competition-entries-images/picture-5.png "Picture 5")

Both these pages show the same information but just in different formats. Although Grid View also allows you to view the Relay Entries. You can assign competitors to events by clicking the **Manage entries** button seen at the top right.

*Available Competitors*
![Available Competitors](/uploads/competition-entries-images/picture-6.png "Picture 6")

This entry screen shows available athletes on the right and events in the pane on the left. 

Clicking through the events on the left-hand side shows the age groups available for that event. For many competitions, there will just be Seniors but many, such as youth and masters, will have various age groups. For example, below you can see the different age groups that can enter the Pole Vault and 400m.

*Age Groups - Filtering*

Clicking on the events and/or age groups will change the available people showing up, dependent on their age group. 

# 1.2 Assigning Athletes
First, ensure that you have the correct event on the left selected and the correct age-group selected. This will show all available athletes for these parameters. 

Once chosen your athlete to enter:
* Double click on them, or
* Single click to select and then click the left arrow

*Assigning Competitors*

To reverse this and “De-Select” the athlete, do the opposite so either:
* Double click on their name under the *Assigned* button, or
* Single click on their name and click the right arrow

Once completed, click **Save** at the top right periodically. 

# 1.3 Down-Aging

Clicking the *Don’t filter* button will ignore the gender and age group category of the athletes and show all athletes for the given club. This is useful if looking to “**down-age**” an athlete. 

Depending on the organiser, they may “close the entries’ a few days before the competition, or even leave it open so team managers can adjust and switch people on the day.
