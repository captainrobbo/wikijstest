# 1.1 Searching for a Competition
From our homepage *data.opentrack.run* click on the *Competitions* button. From here you will be taken to the following page where you can view our list of competitions. Our competition list has been imported directly from European Athletic's database and so is very extensive. It may be that your competition already exists in the list.

From this page, choose either the *Upcoming* or *Past* tab depending on whether your competition is in the future or already happened. Once you have done this you will still be faced with potentially hundreds of events. You can narrow the available options by clicking on the text field located on the right hand side as seen in the above image. From here you can search for the event by typing either the name of the competition, its organiser, the venue or the country it is located in.

Similarly, you can click on the column headings to organise from A to Z.

Once you find your competition, simply click on it to navigate to its homepage.

If the competition does not yet exist, head to #1.2 below.
