# 1.1 Access to OpenTrack
Having an account with appropriate access privileges is the first step required to start using the Competition Management System. 

Without an account you are able to browse the site, view competitions (past and upcoming), prior and present results, and also view our database of athletics venues. However, in order to use the Competition Management System you need an account with access privileges. 

# 1.2 Signing Up
The sign up process is very quick and easy. 

From the home page *data.opentrack.run*, or any of the pages that you find yourself on the website, there will be a button at the top right of the screen that reads *"LOGIN/SIGNUP"*. Click this and you will be taken to the following sign-up screen.

If it shows your name or account name then you already have an account and are logged in.

Simply follow the process through, filling in the requested fields before clicking the blue *"Register"* button at the bottom. Click this only once.

You should shortly (within two minutes) receive an email through from OpenTrack with a confirmation link. Please click this and your account will be confirmed and activated. Should the email not appear, please check your spam/junk email folder. If it is still not here then email *support@opentrack.run* and let us know the issue and we can fix it for you as soon as possible. 

# 1.3 Gaining Access
Now that you have an account to the OpenTrack site, you will need to get access to the competition you are looking after.

Simply email *support@opentrack.run* with your name and the competition you are looking after (along with any other officials, directors, helpers (who must also have accounts) etc) and let us know the access you require for each person and we can set this up for you. 

If you competition does not exist then follow the same process and we can assist with setting this up for you.
