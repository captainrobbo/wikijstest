<!-- TITLE: Test Plan -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: Tyres we need to kick -->

Here's a list of experiments we should carry out...

Authentication:
* can we create users?
* can we allow login through Facebook etc?
* can we authenticate through extra external systems?

Authorisation:
* can we restrict access (view and edit) to specific subdirectories for specific groups of users?


Styling
* can we tweak the style - e.g. to match https://opentrack.run/

Code samples and docs
* are they easy to edit?

Image gallery
* how does it work?  Is it pleasant?

Github:
* How does it look at the GitHub end?
* Can we clone that, write content offline, push back and update without causing total chaos?
