<!-- TITLE: Training Manual - Config Tab -->

Once you have completed the Basics tab of the COmpetition Management System and you will see the options increase in the left hand pane with plenty more tabs available to edit. The first of these is the Configuation tab. Config mainly refers to the general setup of the competition at its initial stage. It is here that you can denote aspects such as entry status, age groups and team types.

The information below shows the steps required to create the event configuration.

1. **Close Date**: This is the end date for team entry declarations if you are choosing this method of entry.
2. **Entries Status**: Choose one of the available three options. If these are not open the the *Teams* button will not display on your event homepage and Team Managers cannot make changes.
3. **Athlete eligibility**: There are six options available that should be self explanatory. 
	* Current Fedaration License relates to countries that use OpenTrack for their Federation Management. Their license must be up-to-date to enter.
	* Current club membership means the athlete must have a valid EA license.
4. **Age Group date**: If your event will not run off the standard UKA age group date of 31/08/yyyy, then select the date you require here. 
5. **Auto-age Groups**: This will calculate and display age groups based on athletes date of birth (e.g. U20, SEN, etc). Click this is you want them displayed.
6. **Use vets age groups**: This will display vets age groups (e.g. V60, V65, etc) for competitions, which is especially useful for masters events with multiple categories. 
7. **Allow competing out of category**: Unless you require athletes to down-age (Masters) or up-age (youth) then **leave this unticked**.
8. **Display category rankings**: This will show the category (age and gender) as well as the age group on the competitor list and results pages. For example, V40 & M40 are both displayed. 
9. **Team Types**: Select from one of the three options available. Ad-hoc teams means teams that will be created purely for your event on a one-off occasion. For example, a pub or work colleagues team.
10. **Exempt date of birth**: Our Competitor list wants dates of birth to be entered. Tick this if you expect to enter some athletes without this information.
11. **Allow relay team additions/removals**: If your competition will have relay events and require Team Managers to select and enter their athletes then tick this button. 
12. **Require athlete checkins**: This required athletes to be manually checked into their event once they arrive. When ticked it creates a *"Tick"* button in the Competitors tab for an organiser to use. 
13. **Guest countries**: This is still in development and does not yet work. 

Whenever you are ready to save your changes, click the blue *Save* button at the bottom right.
