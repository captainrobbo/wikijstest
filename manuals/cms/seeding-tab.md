<!-- TITLE: Training Manual - Seeding Tab -->

Seeding is an important aspect of athletics, required to generate start lists and navigate through heats and rounds. There are a couple of ways to seed and create start lists. These are: 

* Automatic seeding based on qualifying performances
* Manual seeding based on pre-determined list
* Random start list
# 1.1 Automatic Seeding
For Automatic Seeding, click the *Seeding* tab and you will be presented with the tab below.

Your athletes will need to have qualifying performances loaded in for them. The easiest way to do this is to load them in when initially entering your athletes. As you can see below, PB & SB are both inputs on the grid when uploading athletes.
