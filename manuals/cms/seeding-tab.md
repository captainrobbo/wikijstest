<!-- TITLE: Training Manual - Seeding Tab -->

Seeding is an important aspect of athletics, required to generate start lists and navigate through heats and rounds. There are a couple of ways to seed and create start lists. These are: 

* Automatic seeding based on qualifying performances
* Manual seeding based on pre-determined list
* Random start list
# 1.1 Automatic Seeding
In order to seed in this way your athletes will need to have qualifying performances loaded in for them. The easiest way to do this is to load them in when initially entering your athletes. As you can see below, PB & SB are both inputs on the grid when uploading athletes.

*Competitor Input Screen*
![Competitor Input](/uploads/competitors/competitor-input.png "Competitor Input")

For Automatic Seeding, click the *Seeding* tab and you will be presented with the tab below.

*Seeding Tab*
![Seedingscreen](/uploads/seeding/seedingscreen.png "Seedingscreen")

This screen shows all the events that have been loaded for your competition. Firstly, choose the event that you wish to seed and then click *PB / SB* for that event. The resulting screen will show all athletes with their qualifying performances. For those without a qualifying performance, simply click in the relevant box and type the performance in. Click the blue *Save* button once done. 

*Qualifying Performances*
![Pbscreen](/uploads/seeding/pbscreen.png "Pbscreen")

Once all your athletes have qualifying performances, click the *Seeding* button at the to right of the screen. This will bring you to the screen below, which is where you choose the seeding options.

1. **Method**: Choose your seeding method. Currently (as of 06/03/2019) only *Fastest First* & *Fastest Last* work. This stipulates the method both within each heat and from heat to heat.
2. **Heats**: Choose how many heats this event has.
3. **Max / Heat**: Choose the maximum number of competitors that can compete in each heat.
4. **Max Lanes**: Choose maximum (highest) lane number in each heat. This will be the maximum lane number you are using. For example, if lanes 2 and 3 are not available but lane 9 is, you will still type 9, even though the maximum used lanes here would be 7.
5. **Lane Preferences**: Here you stipulate the lane order preference for your competitors. Click the highlighted *?* for more information here to see how this works. In the example above:
The fastest 3 athletes in each heat will be assigned randomly between lanes 4, 5 & 6. The next fastest 3 will be randomly distributed between lanes 2, 7, & 8 with the slowest 2 randomly distributed between 1 & 9. We are not using lane 3. 
	Use the same format as this for whichever distribution you want to use. 

When you have completed these fields, click the blue *Save* button. 

Once this has saved, click the blue *Seed* button.

This will now seed the athletes in the method chosen. In the next two screens you can see how they are distributed across the four heats.

	# 1.1.2 Manual Override

After this event has been seeded you can still manually move athletes around if you want to. 

From the *Seeding* tab choice *Override*. This will take you to the following screen. 

Click on the athlete you wish to change and the appropriate arrows appear:
* Arrows on the left move the athlete up and down lanes in the same heat. 
* Arrows on the right move the athlete up and down between heats.

*Manual Override*

Click *Save* when you are done. 

Navigating to the Event screen will show you how the athletes appear in the heat now they have been seeded.

# 1.2 Manual Seeding
For various reasons, some competitions will not have qualifying performances for their athletes. In these situations it is still possible to seed them into various heats and lane orders however you want. Alternatively, it may be that you just want an entirely random lane draw.

	# 1.2.2 Random Lane Draw

This option will only work if none of your athletes have qualifying performances attached to them.

Head to the *Start Lists / Results* of your event and choose the event you need. If the event has not yet been seeded no athletes will show:

*Event Page*
![Event](/uploads/seeding/event.png "Event")

If you click the blue highlighted *Fetch Start Lists* button. 

*Random Start List*
![Randomseed](/uploads/seeding/randomseed.png "Randomseed")

You can click the *Fetch Start Lists* button again to randomly seed the draw if you want. 

If you want to remove the data, click the red *Delete Data* button at the bottom left.

	# 1.2.3 Pre-determined Lane Draw (including Field Events)

If you have a specific order that you want to your athletes to start in that is not random or a standard seeding method then this is the method to use. Similarly, if you have a specific order that you want your field athletes to compete in then use this method to load them in.

In this example, we will use a track event as it can also show lane draws. However, field events work exactly the same but without loading in a lane draw. 

Firstly, head to the *Start Lists / Results* of your event and choose the event you need. If the event has not yet been seeded no athletes will show. Click either *By Lane* or *Edit* to manually seed your athletes. You can click either - they will both effectively do the same function for this purpose. In this example we have chosen *By Lane*.

*Choose your Manual Seeding Method*
![Bylaneoredit](/uploads/seeding/bylaneoredit.png "Bylaneoredit")

Once you have clicked *By Lane* you will be displayed with the following screen:

*By Lane Screen*
![Bylane](/uploads/seeding/bylane.png "Bylane")

From this screen you can type or paste in this order that you want. You need to include the bib numbers - these will automatically pull through the athlete's details. If you have specific lanes to use (as in the example below) then input these into the *Lane* column. If it is a field event or a road race (i.e. an event without lanes) then just input the bibs in the order required.

*Manual Seeding*

Once you are done inputting the information, click the blue *Save* button.

Clicking *Show Athlete Details* will show further information on the athletes.

*Athlete Details*
![Athletedetails](/uploads/seeding/athletedetails.png "Athletedetails")

Finally, clicking the event name link at the top left of the screen will take you to the event display page to show how the athletes will line up (either in lanes or just in participation order (if a field event)).
