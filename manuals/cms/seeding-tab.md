<!-- TITLE: Training Manual - Seeding Tab -->

Seeding is an important aspect of athletics, required to generate start lists and navigate through heats and rounds. There are a couple of ways to seed and create start lists. These are: 

* Automatic seeding based on qualifying performances
* Manual seeding based on pre-determined list
* Random start list
# 1.1 Automatic Seeding
In order to seed in this way your athletes will need to have qualifying performances loaded in for them. The easiest way to do this is to load them in when initially entering your athletes. As you can see below, PB & SB are both inputs on the grid when uploading athletes.

For Automatic Seeding, click the *Seeding* tab and you will be presented with the tab below.

This screen shows all the events that have been loaded for your competition. Firstly, choose the event that you wish to seed and then click *PB / SB* for that event. The resulting screen will show all athletes with their qualifying performances. For those without a qualifying performance, simply click in the relevant box and type the performance in. Click the blue *Save* button once done.
