<!-- TITLE: Training Manual - Teams Tab -->

The Teams tab is where you can add teams to a match competition and apply bib strings if you have A and B teams.
# 1.1 Adding a Team
Once you have navigated to the *Team* tab you will be shown the teams that have been entered already, if any. 

If you have entered a team and athletes using the *Team Entry* function, as explained here, then the Teams entered from this will already show in the *Team* tab. 

To enter a team from the *Team* tab, click the blue *Add* button at the top right, as shown below.

Once you have clicked the *Add* button the pop-up screen will appear:

*Adding a Match Team*
![Addteam](/uploads/team/addteam.png "Addteam")

* **Team** - Select the type of club you want to add:
	* Ad-hoc: i.e. a made up team just for this competition
	* Registered Team or Organisation: When you begin to type this, the available options will autopopulate from the database and you can click it to fill the options. If using one of these clubs you must keep the club code is provides
	* Foreign Club: a club based outside the UK
* **Code**: Enter a shortened 3-5 digit code for the club - this will often auto-populate. Do not change it unless you have to
* **Match id**: If your competition has a match within it with points scoring, then enter the name of the match in this field but **only for the clubs competing for points** (and not the guest clubs/athletes)
* **Team Name**: Enter the name of your club or team  - this will often auto-populate. Do not change it unless you have to.
* **Bib a**: Enter the (max. 4 digit) code that you wish to assign to A athletes in your team. This is if you have more than 1 team per event. Leave this blank if just one team for every event.
* **Bib b**:  Enter the (max. 4 digit) code that you wish to assign to B athletes in your team. This is if you have more than 1 team per event. Leave this blank if just one team for every event.
* **Team name local**: Enter the name of your team in a local language if applicable
* **Flag URL**: Enter the URL where the system can pull through a picture of the club flag. Contact *support@opentrack.run* if you need one made for you.

When done, click the blue *Save Changes* button at the bottom. 

Below are examples of the *Team* tab with various teams added. As you can see, England and Wales have been entered into the points scoring match of "WAII" whilst the other clubs are guests, so will not contribute to the points. This means that if, for example, Cardiff Athletics finished first in an event with England second, England will still receive points for first place. You can also see that England, Cardiff Athletics & Rhymney Valley AC have all entered two teams, as they have an A String and a B String. Their bib numbers are denoted by what is written here: ENG1 & ENG2 as an example. This is especially important for relays (here).
