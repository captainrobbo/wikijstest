<!-- TITLE: Training Manual - Results Recording - Field Events -->

# 1.1 Introduction

The purpose of the field recording screens is to ease the workload for Meeting Organisers & Officials and to provide a better experience for athletes & spectators. 

Results can be inputted during the event; this is easy and instantaneous and provides the perfect way to view how field events are unfolding. 

Alternatively results can be inputted in bulk after the competition.
# 1.2 Live Recording

As with everything, please ensure you are logged in and have appropriate access privileges. 

From your Competition Homepage, click the blue *Start Lists / Results* button. 

*Competition Homepage*
![Startlistselection](/uploads/recording-field-events/startlistselection.png "Startlistselection")

From the following screen, below, choose the relevant event that you wish to record. In this instance we are selecting High Jump.

*Event Selection*
![Eventselection](/uploads/recording-field-events/eventselection.png "Eventselection")

Once you have opened the event in question you will see the list of competitors. However, if this is the first time this event has been opened then the competitors will not yet be loaded. To do this click the blue *Fetch Start List* button at the top right, as seen below. This will generate a random order of competitors. If you require a specific order then you can click the *"Edit"* button located to the left of the orange *"Record"*. Click [here](/manuals/cms/seeding-tab) and go to 1.2.3 to learn how this works.

If you require to remove the data and start again, click the red *Delete Data* button at the bottom left. 

*Fetching Start Lists*
![Fetchstartlist](/uploads/issues/fetchstartlist-2.png "Fetchstartlist")

Once this has been loaded you will be presented with the list of competitors entered into this event. If required you can now download a Field Card (PDF format) of the Start List by clicking the *Start List* button to the left of *Fetch Start List*. 

Now you have the list of competitors, you can start to enter results as the athletes record jumps. To do this, click the orange *Record* button as seen below.

*Click Record to Enter Results*
![Clickrecord](/uploads/issues/enterresults.png "Clickrecord")

Clicking *Record* will take you to an editable screen where, at the beginning, all competitors are highlighted in green. This denotes they have not suffered any fouls, retired or been disqualified. 

Depending on whether the field event is a vertical or horizontal measurement, the method of input differs. We will look at Vertical first.

	# 1.21 Vertical Disciplines

The first step to take is to raise the bar height from 0.00cm. To do this click the blue *Raise* button as seen below. 

*Raising the Bar*
![Raisebar](/uploads/recording-field-events/raisebar.png "Raisebar")

From this screen, you need to choose a height, either selected by competitor or the competition's starting height. The height can be edited at any time when a competitor chooses to raise it. To choose the height, click in the box that appeared when you click the *Raise* button. Click in the box and type the desired height, as seen below. When finished click the blue *New Height* button.

*Choosing New Height*
![Chooseheight](/uploads/recording-field-events/chooseheight.png "Chooseheight")

The new height will now be displayed at the top of the competitors, with the jump number indicated at the top left. To begin recording click on the athlete who will be jumping. In this instance, we have chosen David Drake. Once this is done you will be shown the orange *Record* button, as seen below. Click this.

*Recording a Height*
![Startrecord](/uploads/recording-field-events/startrecord.png "Startrecord")

After clicking this button you will be shown the four relevant options: 

*Recording Options*
![Record](/uploads/recording-field-events/record.png "Record")

"R" = Retire
"-" = Pass
"O" = Over
"X" = Fail

Below are some examples showing the display format depending on how the athletes do:

*Passed First Time*
![Passedfirsttime](/uploads/recording-field-events/passedfirsttime.png "Passedfirsttime")

*Failed at First Attempt*
![Failedfirsttime](/uploads/recording-field-events/failedfirsttime.png "Failedfirsttime")

*Retired at First Jump*
![Retiredfirsttime](/uploads/recording-field-events/retiredfirsttime.png "Retiredfirsttime")

*Failed at Second Attempt*
![Twofails](/uploads/recording-field-events/twofails.png "Twofails")

*Second Height Entered*
![Secondheight](/uploads/recording-field-events/secondheight.png "Secondheight")

	# 1.22 Horizontal Disciplines
	
For horizontal disciplines the method is exactly the same until the point up after you have generated a start list, either by clicking *Fetch Start List* or manually created a specific order via the *Edit* button - this is explained [here](/manuals/cms/seeding-tab) at 1.2.3. For this example we are using Shot Put.

With the horizontal disciplines, after clicking *Record* you will be met with the following screen:

*Competitor List*
![Choose Competitor](/uploads/horizontal/choose-competitor.png "Choose Competitor")

From this screen, choose the athlete that you want to record a distance for by clicking on their name. Once done, you will be met with the orange *Record* button as below. Click this to record the distance.

*Choose a Competitor to Record*
![Click Record](/uploads/horizontal/click-record.png "Click Record")

Once the *Record* button has been clicked, the recording box will pop up. 

*Recording a Distance*
![Set Distance](/uploads/horizontal/set-distance.png "Set Distance")

Click in the *Distance* box to bring up the keyboard and type in the distance thrown by the athlete. 

Click the blue Tick at the bottom right to record the distance.

If you clicked on the wrong athlete, choose the white X.

If the athlete recorded a foul, click the red F.

For events, such as Long Jump, where wind is recorded in the results, you follow the same process but when you click the *Record* button, the following screen appears:

*Recording Wind Speed*
![Wind](/uploads/horizontal/wind.png "Wind")

Use the same process to record the wind speed as you do to enter the distance.

# 1.3 Post Event Results Input 

If, for whatever reason, you are unable to do live recording during the event, then the data can still be input from field cards immediately afterwards. This will provide quick results for spectators and instant updates of scoring, if applicable. The method is also very easy, thereby easing workload for officials. 

As with most recording input screens, from your Competition homepage, click Start Lists / Results. From the resulting screen, choose the event in question. 

	1.3.1 Horizontal Events

In this example we have selected a Shot Put competition. Once you have clicked your event, you will be presented with the screen below.

*Shot Put Event*
![Load List](/uploads/fieldevent-postevent/load-list.png "Load List")

In this example, no competitors have been loaded. If you are happy with just a random starting order, click the blue *Fetch Start List* button at the top right. If you would like a specific order then click [here](/manuals/cms/seeding-tab) and go to 1.2.3 to learn how.

*Competitor List*
![Competitor List](/uploads/fieldevent-postevent/competitor-list.png "Competitor List")

Once the competitors are loaded in and you are ready to enter the results, click the highlighted *Edit* button. This will present you with the following screen:

*Results Edit Screen*
![Edit Screen](/uploads/fieldevent-postevent/edit-screen.png "Edit Screen")

The default view from this screen is just the *Summary*, as highlighted in blue. This allows you to just enter the best result per athlete. To enter all the rounds, click the *Details* button.

*Edit Details*
![Edit Details](/uploads/fieldevent-postevent/edit-details.png "Edit Details")

Once you have clicked *Details* you will be shown all the available rounds. Simply paste the results in from a pre-populated speadsheet or type them in. The system knows which athlete corresponds to which bib so just match the results to the bib. Once you click *Save* then the *Place* column will automatically populate. Finally, it is possible to enter the weight of the Shot for each athlete in here.

You can also click the *Show Athlete Details* button to view more information, such as the name and club. 

*Show Athlete Details*
![Showathletedetails](/uploads/fieldevent-postevent/showathletedetails.png "Showathletedetails")

Clicking the name of the competition at the top left in blue will take you back to the results output. Here you can see the display of results, including athlete names, clubs, rounds, best efforts and weight thrown.

*Results Display*
![Result Display](/uploads/fieldevent-postevent/result-display.png "Result Display")
	
For Long Jump & Triple Jump there is also the option to input a wind speed per round. Follow the same process as above with the Shot Put but when you are in the *Edit* screen and have clicked *Details* you will see the format as below:

*Entering Wind Speed*
![Windinput](/uploads/fieldevent-postevent/windinput.png "Windinput")

This will show in the results display in brackets underneath each competitor's effort.

*Wind Speed Display*
![Winddisplay](/uploads/fieldevent-postevent/winddisplay.png "Winddisplay")

	1.3.2 Vertical Events

Unlike with horizontal events, there are no weight or wind variables with the vertical disciplines; Pole Vault & High Jump both work the same - we have chosen High Jump in this example. So firstly click your chosen event from the Event list, found from the *Start Lists/Results* section. 

Similar to the Shot Put example above, if no competitors hasve been loaded and you are happy with just a random starting order, click the blue *Fetch Start List* button at the top right. If you would like a specific order then click [here](/manuals/cms/seeding-tab) to learn how.

Once the competitors are loaded in and you are ready to enter the results, click the *Edit* button. This will present you with the following screen:

*Summary*
![Summary](/uploads/field-event-post-vertical/summary.png "Summary")

The above is just the *Summary* screen. If you click the *Show Athlete Details* button then you can view further information - Names, Club, Category:

*Athlete Details*
![Athletedetails](/uploads/field-event-post-vertical/athletedetails.png "Athletedetails")

In order to progress further with the results input, click the *Details* button. This will reveal an *Add height* box and button shown on the right hand side: 

*Adding a Height*
![Details](/uploads/field-event-post-vertical/details.png "Details")

If you type in the height that you want to enter results for and click the button then a new column will appear in the grid.

*Add Height*
![Addheight](/uploads/field-event-post-vertical/addheight.png "Addheight")

From here, type in the results for the competitors for this height:
"r" = Retire
"-" = Pass
"o" = Over
"x" = Fail

Once you have done this, click *Save* at the top right or bottom right.

*Results Input - One Height*
![Oneheightresults](/uploads/field-event-post-vertical/oneheightresults.png "Oneheightresults")

It is possible to add multiple heights before inputting any results. However, if you do this, you must enter a result for all competitors in all heights before hitting *Save* otherwise the data will be lost. This is only for available jumps - for example, if an athlete has retired or failed three times at the same height, then you do not need to enter anything in subsequent heights.  If you have only recorded a "pass" for an athlete then results will remain blank for that person - only once the a "retire", "over" or "fail" has been recorded will results show up for them. See the example below:

*Multiple Heights Input*
![Multipleheights](/uploads/field-event-post-vertical/multipleheights.png "Multipleheights")

Once saved, click the title of the event at the top left to return and view the results:

*Results*
![Results](/uploads/field-event-post-vertical/results.png "Results")
