# 1.1 Introduction

The purpose of the field recording screens is to ease the workload for Meeting Organisers & Officials and to provide a better experience for athletes & spectators. The entry input is easy and instantaneous and provides the perfect way to view how field events are unfolding. 

Track events are covered here for the manual input and here for automatic input via Timing Integration.

Once you have opened the event in question you will see the list of competitors. However, if this is the first time this event has been opened then the competitors will not yet be loaded. To do this click the blue *Fetch Start List* button at the top right, as seen below. This will generate a random order of competitors. If you require a specific order then you can click the *"Edit"* button located to the left of the orange *"Record"*. Click here to learn how this works.
