<!-- TITLE: Training Manual - Live Results Recording - Field Events -->

# 1.1 Introduction

The purpose of the field recording screens is to ease the workload for Meeting Organisers & Officials and to provide a better experience for athletes & spectators. 

Results can be inputted during the event; this is easy and instantaneous and provides the perfect way to view how field events are unfolding. 

Alternatively results can be inputted in bulk after the competition.
# 1.2 Live Recording

As with everything, please ensure you are logged in and have appropriate access privileges. 

From your Competition Homepage, click the blue *Start Lists / Results* button. 

*Competition Homepage*

From the following screen, below, choose the relevant event that you wish to record. In this instance we are selecting High Jump.

*Event Selection*
![Eventselection](/uploads/recording-field-events/eventselection.png "Eventselection")

Once you have opened the event in question you will see the list of competitors. However, if this is the first time this event has been opened then the competitors will not yet be loaded. To do this click the blue *Fetch Start List* button at the top right, as seen below. This will generate a random order of competitors. If you require a specific order then you can click the *"Edit"* button located to the left of the orange *"Record"*. Click here to learn how this works.

If you require to remove the data and start again, click the red *Delete Data* button at the bottom left. 

*Fetching Start Lists*
![Fetchstartlist](/uploads/recording-field-events/fetchstartlist.png "Fetchstartlist")

Once this has been loaded you will be presented with the list of competitors entered into this event. If required you can now download a Field Card (PDF format) of the Start List by clicking the *Start List* button to the left of *Fetch Start List*. 

Now you have the list of competitors, you can start to enter results as the athletes record jumps. To do this, click the orange *Record* button as seen below.

*Click Record to Enter Results*
![Clickrecord](/uploads/recording-field-events/clickrecord.png "Clickrecord")

Clicking *Record* will take you to an editable screen where, at the beginning, all competitors are highlighted in green. This denotes they have not suffered any fouls, retired or been disqualified. 

Depending on whether the field event is a vertical or horizontal measurement, the method of input differs. We will look at Vertical first.

	# 1.21 Vertical Disciplines

The first step to take is to raise the bar height from 0.00cm. To do this click the blue *Raise* button as seen below. 

*Raising the Bar*
![Raisebar](/uploads/recording-field-events/raisebar.png "Raisebar")

From this screen, you need to choose a height, either selected by competitor or the competition's starting height. The height can be edited at any time when a competitor chooses to raise it. To choose the height, click in the box that appeared when you click the *Raise* button. Click in the box and type the desired height, as seen below. When finished click the blue *New Height* button.

*Choosing New Height*
![Chooseheight](/uploads/recording-field-events/chooseheight.png "Chooseheight")

The new height will now be displayed at the top of the competitors, with the jump number indicated at the top left. To begin recording click on the athlete who will be jumping. In this instance, we have chosen David Drake. Once this is done you will be shown the orange *Record* button, as seen below. Click this.

*Recording a Height*
![Startrecord](/uploads/recording-field-events/startrecord.png "Startrecord")

After clicking this button you will be shown the three relevant options: 

*Recording Options*
![Record](/uploads/recording-field-events/record.png "Record")

R = Retire
O = Over
X = Fail

In this instance we are going to say that David passed first time. 

*Passed First Time*

Below are some other options showing the display format depending on how the athletes do:

*Failed at First Attempt*

*Retired at First Jump*
![Retiredfirsttime](/uploads/recording-field-events/retiredfirsttime.png "Retiredfirsttime")

*Failed at Second Attempt*
![Twofails](/uploads/recording-field-events/twofails.png "Twofails")

*Second Height Entered*
![Secondheight](/uploads/recording-field-events/secondheight.png "Secondheight")

	# 1.22 Horizontal Disciplines
	
For horizontal disciplines the method is exactly the same until the point up after you have *Fetched Start List* and clicked *Record*. For this example we are using Shot Put.

With the horizontal disciplines, after clicking *Record* you will be met with the following screen:

*Competitor List*
![Choose Competitor](/uploads/horizontal/choose-competitor.png "Choose Competitor")

From this screen, choose the athlete that you want to record a distance for by clicking on their name. Once done, you will be met with the orange *Record* button as below. Click this to record the distance.

*Choose a Competitor to Record*
![Click Record](/uploads/horizontal/click-record.png "Click Record")

Once the *Record* button has been clicked, the recording box will pop up. 

*Recording a Distance*
![Set Distance](/uploads/horizontal/set-distance.png "Set Distance")

Click in the *Distance* box to bring up the keyboard and type in the distance thrown by the athlete. 

Click the blue Tick at the bottom right to record the distance.

If you clicked on the wrong athlete, choose the white X.

If the athlete recorded a foul, click the red F.

For events, such as Long Jump, where wind is recorded in the results, you follow the same process but when you click the *Record* button, the following screen appears:

*Recording Wind Speed*
![Wind](/uploads/horizontal/wind.png "Wind")

Use the same process to record the wind speed as you do to enter the distance.
