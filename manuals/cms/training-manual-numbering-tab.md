<!-- TITLE: Training Manual - Numbering Tab -->

This tab is used to apply bib numbers to your competitiors.

Often competitors already have pre-assigned bib numbers, i.e. some countries assign all their registered athletes to a number at the beginning of the year; when they are allocated to a competition their bib number is automatically assigned. Alternatively, organisers may already have bibs organised and so paste them into the competition along with the athletes. When bibs are not already assigned, the Numbering system is used.
