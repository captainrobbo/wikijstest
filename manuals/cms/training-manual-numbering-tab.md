<!-- TITLE: Training Manual - Numbering Tab -->

This tab is used to apply bib numbers to your competitiors.

# 1.1 Introduction
Often competitors already have pre-assigned bib numbers, i.e. some countries assign all their registered athletes to a number at the beginning of the year; when they are allocated to a competition their bib number is automatically assigned. Alternatively, organisers may already have bibs organised and so paste them into the competition along with the athletes. When bibs are not already assigned, the Numbering system is used. 

# 1.2 Using the Numbering Function
There are a few different numbering and ordering methods to choose from. Only athletes who do not already have a number will be given one; nothing is overwritten unless Clear Numbers is clicked.
