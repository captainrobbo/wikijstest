<!-- TITLE: Training Manual - Numbering Tab -->

This tab is used to apply bib numbers to your competitiors.

# 1.1 Introduction
Often competitors already have pre-assigned bib numbers, i.e. some countries assign all their registered athletes to a number at the beginning of the year; when they are allocated to a competition their bib number is automatically assigned. Alternatively, organisers may already have bibs organised and so paste them into the competition along with the athletes. When bibs are not already assigned, the Numbering system is used. 

# 1.2 Using the Numbering Function
There are a few different numbering and ordering methods to choose from. Only athletes who do not already have a number will be given one; nothing is overwritten unless Clear Numbers is clicked.

	# 1.2.1 Numbering Systems

There are five different Numbering systems to choose from:

1. Unique numbers, automatic
	Everyone is assigned a unique number automatic
	
2. Unique numbers, assigned manually
	This method essentially stipulates that you wish to assign the bib numbers manually; it will not actually make any changes. You need to head to the *Competitors* tab and manually paste the bib numbers into the column or click on each athlete and type it in.
	
3. Repeat for each gender
	Numbers that are assigned are duplicated for each gender. For example, if you order by surname, the first male and first female athletes would both be given bib 1. These are differentiated by a gender variation, i.e. 1-M and 1-F and so on. The suffix will not be seen on competitorâ€™s physical number, but the system needs it to make the ID unique.
	
4. Repeat for each age group
	This works the same as Number 3 but for age group rather than gender, i.e. 1-U14, 1-SEN, etc. 
	
5. Repeat for each category
	This works the same as Numbers 3 & 4 but for a (user-defined) category. 

		# 1.2.2 Ordering Methods

Once you have chosen your Numbering System, you can select the method by which you wish the bib numbers to the be assigned.  There are seven separate ordering methods:

1) Alphabetical on family name 
2) Event (short sprints first)
3) Age Group
4) Gender
5) Category
6) Tea or Club Code
7) Performance

Youu can select three at any one time and define the order by which they assign. For example, choosing *Alphabetical on family name* will assign consecutively from A down to Z. If you have two competitors with the same surname, then this is where Order 2 comes into play. If you chose *Age Group* for Order 2, then it will put the younger age group as the lower available bib number. 

		# 1.2.3 Numbers Available

This is where you select the bib number range you have available. You can put multiple ranges in here, for example you could just write *"1+"*, which would give you all available numbers. If you have more defined list, you can specify it, for example *"15-35,50-65,200+"*.
