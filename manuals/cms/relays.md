# Setting up relay teams
Relays are complicated.  A Relay Team is not necessarily the same as a team contesting the match.   Sometimes each club has one team, and that's simple.  But sometimes we have, for example, England A and England B.  And sometimes runners just want to practice, and make up teams to fill out the track, so we effectively have guest teams.

The first step is to set up the teams in the match.  Go to Manage Teams.  There should already be an automatically created team for each club that has entered the match through our Team Entry system.  

## A and B teams
If you just have one team for each club, do nothing more.  If you have A and B relay teams for a team in the match, such as in the example below, you need to choose a bib number to identify them.  You can click on a team and edit this.  In this example, England has bibs E1 and E2 assigned, and Wales has W1 and W2.  This would normally be the number on their chest.

## Ad-hoc and non-scoring teams
At the Loughborough International, we had proper teams contesting the match, and we also had a number of relay teams thrown together shortly before the match.  The organisers therefore set up some extra match teams, named IND1 to IND9, for individuals.  At club level, you might ask the runners to make up a code and name.  Below we show an example.



It is important to clear or empty the *Match* field, which will remove them from any scores.  Otherwise, you'd end up with the scoring reports showing an extra club doing rather badly, as it scored zero in all other events.  This shows the team-editing dialog:
