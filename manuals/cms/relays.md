# Setting up relay teams
Relays are complicated.  A Relay Team is not necessarily the same as a team contesting the match.   Sometimes each club has one team, and that's simple.  But sometimes we have, for example, England A and England B.  And sometimes runners just want to practice, and make up teams to fill out the track, so we effectively have guest teams.

The first step is to set up the teams in the match.  Go to Manage Teams.  There should already be an automatically created team for each club that has entered the match through our Team Entry system.
