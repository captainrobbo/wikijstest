<!-- TITLE: Training Manual - Finalize Tab-->

Finalize is the last tab in the *Manage* section of the Competition Management System. It is still in development (as of 4th April 2019) but it's primary two functions work.
# 1.1 Recalculate all units
This function is based around [Scoring](/manuals/cms-scoring-tab). If you implement and save a Scoring method after results have already been posted then you need to click the *Recalculate all units* button to recalibrate to the new method.

*Click 'Recalculate all units'*

# 1.2 Remove empty units
As of 4th April 2019 this function is still in development.
# 1.3 Mark all results official
Whenever results are entered into an event of a competition they are automatically marked as *'Provisional'*. From the list of events this looks like the screen below:

*Partial Results*
![Partial](/uploads/finalize/partial.png "Partial")

Clicking into an individual event and then clicking *Details* will show the the results as *Provisional*.

*Provisional Results*
![Provisional](/uploads/finalize/provisional.png "Provisional")

You can edit the *Status* of the event on the right hand side. For example, change it to *Finished* once it is completed and then click *Change Status.*

This is also where results are makred as official. Clicking the drop down will present the four available options. Once an event as started they will be marked as *Provisional Results*. Once finished, change this to *Official Results* and click *Change Status.*

If you have lots of events it can be very time consuming to do this individually per event. Navigate to the *Finalize* tab in *Manage.*

If you click *Mark all results official* then all results in all events will be marked as *Official* so only click this when all events are done. 

**Power of 10 will only accept the results if they are marked as *Official*.**

When the events have been marked as *Official* then you can see the updated screens as below:

*Events Marked as Complete*

*Event Marked as Official*
