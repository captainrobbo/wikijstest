<!-- TITLE: Training Manual - Team Manager: Team Entries -->

# 1.1 Introduction
One of the major purposes of the Federation Management System is to manage entries to competitions and assign competitors to events.

In order to do this the user needs to have Team Manager privileges. Request this by contacting support@opentrack.run

Once access privileges to the competition have been granted, you must be logged in.

*Log-In Screen*

Following this, navigate to the competition in question. From the homepage, click *Competitions* and then use the search bar to narrow the results field before clicking on your competition. 

N.B. If you are trying to find a previous competition, click the *Past* tab first.

*Competition Micro-Site*

Once into your competition home-page, click *Teams*.

# 1.2 Team Entries

From here, you can view the competitors (see CMS Manual 2.9), and the teams entered to the competition.

*Teams Entered*

If your club is not showing, your Team Manager privileges will show a button at the top right with the drop down of clubs you have access to add. Select the relevant club and add them in. 

*Adding a New Club*

Example here is EMAC. From this page, you can view the competitors of this club and what events they are assigned to, either in List View or Grid View:

*List View - Competitors*
![Entries List View](/uploads/competition-entries-images/entries-list-view.png "Entries List View")

*Grid View - Competitors*
![Entries Grid View](/uploads/competition-entries-images/entries-grid-view.png "Entries Grid View")

Both these pages show the same information but just in different formats. Although Grid View also allows you to view the Relay Entries. You can assign competitors to events by clicking the **Manage entries** button seen at the top right. The following screen shows the competitors that are available for your club. The screen below shows available athletes on the right and events in the pane on the left. 

*Available Competitors*

Clicking through the events on the left-hand side shows the age groups available for that event. For some competitions, there will just be one age group available (i.e. Seniors only) but many meetings, such as youth and masters competitions will have various age groups. For example, below you can see the different age groups that can enter the Pole Vault and 400m. Clicking on the events on the left and/or the age groups ar the top will change the available athletes showing up, deending on their age group and gender.  

*Age Groups Available for Pole Vault*

*Age Groups Available for 400m*

# 1.3 Assigning Athletes
To assign athletes to an event, firstly ensure that you have the correct event on the left selected and the correct age-group selected at the top. This will show all available athletes for these parameters. 

Once you have chosen your athlete, to enter them do the following:
* Double click on them, or
* Single click to select and then click the left arrow

*Assigning Competitors from Available List*
![Athlete Selection](/uploads/competition-entries-images/athlete-selection.png "Athlete Selection")

*![Athlete Selection 2](/uploads/competition-entries-images/athlete-selection-2.png "Athlete Selection 2")

To reverse this and “De-Select” the athlete, do the opposite so either:
* Double click on their name under the *Assigned* button, or
* Single click on their name and click the right arrow

Once completed, click **Save** at the top right periodically. 
# 1.4 Down-Aging
For Masters competitions, and various others, team managers may want or need to assign athletes out of category, for example "**down-aging**" - V55 competing with the V50s. This needs to be initially configured in the Configuation of the Competition Management. 

Clicking the *Don’t filter* button will ignore the gender and age group category of the athletes and show all athletes for the given club.

# 1.5 When to complete entries
This varies competition to competition. Depending on the organiser, they may “close the entries’ a few days before the competition, or even leave it open so team managers can adjust and switch people on the day. Ensure you check with the meeting director instead of leaving it too late for your entries.
