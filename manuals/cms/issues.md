This will bring up the following screen, where the person can fill in the Subject and Description of their issue. It is also possible to prioritise from 1 (Very Low) to 5 (critical). Simply fill in the boxes and click *submit*. The name of the Competition or Meeting is autofilled. If you are on the page of a specific event when you click the the *Report Issue* button then the Event will also be autofilled.
