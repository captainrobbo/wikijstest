<!-- TITLE: TV Feed Overlay -->

This TV overlay has been created as a basic setup for displaying data over the top of a live action TV feed. It is by no means up to the proficiency of those you see on the BBC but as a free alternative it works very well.
# 1.1 Setting up the Overlay
Firstly head to the website: https://tv.opentrack.run/

Here you will be presented with the following screen:

*TV Feed Homepage*
![Homepage](/uploads/tv/homepage.png "Homepage")

Use the *Left* and *Right* cursor keys to hide and display the Control Panel on the left, as can be seen below:

*Displaying the Control Panel*
![Usecursorkeys](/uploads/tv/usecursorkeys.png "Usecursorkeys")

If you click on the various options from the Control Panel then they will expand and collapse. 

	# 1.1.1 Options
	
Firstly, click *Options*:

*Options*
![Options](/uploads/tv/options.png "Options")

*Theme*: The options from this drop down simply change the display layout of the Control Panel.
*Screen Cursor*: Hinfs the cursor when you move it over the screen outside the Control Panel.
*Transitions*:
**Show Blank background?: Make sure you click this to remove the intial stadium background and replace it with a blank blue screen.**
*Background Colour*:



	# 1.1.2 Configuration
	
	
After sorting your *Options*, you can click it again to collapse this setting and then choose *Configuration:*

![Configuration](/uploads/tv/configuration.png "Configuration")

*API Mode*: Choose Live, unless you are just testing the system.
*Country*: Choose the country of the competition.
*Year*: This will default to the current year but it is configurable.
*Language*: Choose from the drop down.
*Use local names*: Default to be ticked.


	# 1.1.3 Meeting

Once you have set your Country & Year, you can select the *Meeting* panel at the top of the page. Once you have done this, click *Get Meeting list* - you will now be displayed with the list of meetings in the country and year of selection.

*Meeting List*
![Meeting](/uploads/tv/meeting.png "Meeting")

Should you need to change, just go back to the *Options*, swap them around and then come back and click *Get Meeting list* again. In this example, we have chosen Malta & 2018. Click the competition you are looking after and the *Meeting* panel will collapse, replaced by the pre-loaded *Event* panel with all the events of the competition:

	# 1.1.4 Event

Click on the Event that you are displaying or that is currently live and now you can start to look at the different display overlays - *Screen* panel. 

![Event](/uploads/tv/event.png "Event")

	# 1.1.5 Screen

This is where you choose what is shown on top of the live feed.

*Screen*
![Scree](/uploads/tv/scree.png "Scree")

The examples below are shown with the *Control Panel* hidden:

*Timetable (click the up and down arrow cursor key to scroll through the timetable*
![Timetable](/uploads/tv/timetable.png "Timetable")

*Start Lists*
![Startlist](/uploads/tv/startlist.png "Startlist")

*Results*
![Results](/uploads/tv/results.png "Results")

*Scores - only displayed if the competition has Scores implemented*

*With Logo - this squashes the display to fit an extra logo on the screen*
![Withlogo](/uploads/tv/withlogo.png "Withlogo")

	# 1.1.7 Timer

This works alongside the *Screen* options above. So select *Timer* from the *Screen* dropdown to display the Timer at the bottom right. Then use the *Start, Stop & Reset* buttons from the *Timer* dropdown to control it. This is manual so used more as a guide alongside a race; it doesn't link up to PhotoFinish - it would be very difficult to use for a 100m due to the short time of the discipline but for 5000m it would be more do-able.

	# 1.1.6 Scoreboards

Click the *Get Latest Scores* button to display the scores. This only works if your competition has a scoring method implemented.
