<!-- TITLE: Scoring Tab -->

The scoring tab can be used to set up scoring for points and categories across athletics meets and distance races, such as road and cross country.
# 1.1 Athletics Scoring
This is for athletics (Track & Field) meets so covers all disciplines of athletics. 

Firstly, choose the *Scoring* tab on the left hand side of the Manage screen. From here, click the *Scoring System* drop down and this will provide the options available. All of these have been prepared ad-hoc upon request. If the system you require is not listed here then please enquire to *support@opentrack.run* to see if we can implement the system you need.

*Track & Field Scoring Options*

In this example, we have chosen *Welsh Indoor Intl (5-3-2-1)*, which was first used on 3rd March 2019 for the annual Wales V England U20s Indoor International event:

Once you have selected the Scoring system you want to use, click *Save*. 

With the Wales V England U20s Indoor International event, there are 2 teams competing with 2 athletes (per team) in each event. *Welsh Indoor Intl (5-3-2-1)* scoring system is defined as follows:
**Points**
5 = Winner
3 = Second
2 = Third
1 = Fourth
Bonus Point = Meeting Record Performance

Before any points can be allocated, you need to enter the *Teams* into the competition so the system knows they are to score. Head to the *Teams* tab and enter the relevant teams into the match competition. Click here to learn how.

In this example, we have a few guest clubs for will not be competing for points and England & Wales who will be - they have been entered into the match, as you can see by the code *WAII*.

The *A String* & *B String* relates to relays - England entered 2 teams into a relay event, whilst Wales only entered 1 - this field denotes what A & B String runners will wear on their vests. For all other events, competitors wear normal bib numbers (i.e. 1, 2, 3) and their club (England or Wales) is specified when the competitors enter.
