<!-- TITLE: Scoring Tab -->

The scoring tab can be used to set up scoring for points and categories across athletics meets and distance races, such as road and cross country.
# 1.1 Athletics Scoring
This is for athletics (Track & Field) meets so covers all disciplines of athletics. 

Firstly, choose the *Scoring* tab on the left hand side of the Manage screen. From here, click the *Scoring System* drop down and this will provide the options available. All of these have been prepared ad-hoc upon request. If the system you require is not listed here then please enquire to *support@opentrack.run* to see if we can implement the system you need.
