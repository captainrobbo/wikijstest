<!-- TITLE: Training Manual - Create a New Competition -->

Firstly, ensure that you are logged in to the site. 
# 1.1 Searching for a Competition
From our homepage *data.opentrack.run* click on the *Competitions* button. From here you will be taken to the following page where you can view our list of competitions. Our competition list has been imported directly from European Athletic's database and so is very extensive. It may be that your competition already exists in the list. 

*Searching for a Competition*

From this page, choose either the *Upcoming* or *Past* tab depending on whether your competition is in the future or already happened. Once you have done this you will still be faced with potentially hundreds of events. You can narrow the available options by clicking on the text field located on the right hand side as seen in the above image. From here you can search for the event by typing either the name of the competition, its organiser, the venue or the country it is located in.

Similarly, you can click on the column headings to organise from A to Z.

Once you find your competition, simply click on it to navigate to its homepage.

If the competition does not yet exist, head to #1.2 below.
# 1.2 Creating a New Competition
From the Competition homepage, click the drop down arrow on the right-hand side and choose the country your competition is set in. Following this, click the blue *New Competition* button. See the image below.

*Step 1*
![Comp Home](/uploads/create-competitions/comp-home.png "Comp Home")

Following this you will be taken to the next screen. 

*Step 2*
![New Comp](/uploads/create-competitions/new-comp.png "New Comp")

From the screen above, you need to fill in the options provided. 
1. **Name (english)**: Type the name you wish to give your competition. If, for example, your event is annual, you do not need to include the year in the title.
2. **Date**: Scroll to and select the first day of your event. At a later stage you will be able to select an end date.
3. **Location**: Type the address of your event. You can type the postcode or street name. If a road road or X-Country, choose the start point.
4. **Competition Type**: Choose the type of competition.
5. **Slug**: This will form part of the URL and must be a short code. Do not include the year of the competition as this comes separately in the URL. For example, the directory for the OpenTrack Demonstration competition is *https://data.opentrack.run/x/2018/GBR/ot_demo/*. The slug is simply *"ot_demo"* with the year and country completed automatically.

Once done, click the blue *Create* button at the bottom right. This will take you to the *Basic Tab* of the Competition Management System.
