This page describes APIs for developers.

## Uploading competition results
OpenTrack can accept a description of a competition in JSON format.  The format is pretty much the same as the one available for downloading.
To use the upload API, you need to contact OpenTrack and arrange credentials.  We will carefully check the first few uploads.

### Test Harness
A test harness is available at http://data.opentrack.run/x/create.  This lets you validate JSON packets simply by copying and pasting

### API for creation
The actual request should be a POST to /x/api/create/
